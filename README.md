# Kort Reloaded
This is a new frontend implementation of Kort. Kort as we know it is still available on http://play.kort.ch. But meanwhile, the web app only works in Firefox.

The goal of this project is to provide a native app for Android as well as iOS keeping the functionality basically the same.

Kort Reloaded is implemented with React Native (https://facebook.github.io/react-native).

## Release
The implementation is estimated to be finished by the end of June 2016.

It might require additional time to be deployed to the app stores of the the respective platforms.

## Hands On
We gladly accept any kind of contribution if you wish to help!

Please note, that currently we are collecting issues internally, i.e. as a private Redmine project.

If you wish to run the current version of the app you will have to set up React Native on your machine.
